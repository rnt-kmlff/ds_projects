    "# Unveiling the Numbers: Analyzing Winning Probabilities in the 6/49 Lottery\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our analysis is to develop a logical core for a possible mobile app that aids individuals with gambling addictions in estimating their chances of winning the 6/49 lottery. Our approach involves building functions to address key inquiries, such as the probability of winning the grand prize with a single ticket, the probability of winning with multiple tickets, and the probability of having a certain number of winning numbers on a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout our project, we made findings that showcase the effectiveness of our approach. We determined that the likelihood of winning the grand prize with any combination of six numbers is extremely low, approximately 0.000007%. Additionally, we created a function enabling app users to compare their ticket against historical lottery data from Canada, allowing them to ascertain if they would have won in the past. Furthermore, we developed a function to calculate the winning probabilities for any number of tickets, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of their chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis also incorporated the calculation of probabilities for winning smaller prizes, specifically two, three, four, or five numbers out of the six drawn. By presenting these essential results concisely, we ensure that our findings are effectively communicated and easily digestible."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our project aimed to create a logical core for a mobile app that assists individuals with gambling addictions by providing them with valuable insights into their chances of winning the 6/49 lottery. Through our analysis, we successfully developed functions that address key inquiries, including the probability of winning the grand prize with a single ticket, the probability of winning with multiple tickets, and the probability of obtaining various numbers of winning numbers on a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout our investigation, we made significant findings that shed light on the challenging odds faced by lottery players. The chance of winning the grand prize with any combination of six numbers was found to be extremely low, approximately 0.000007%. We also implemented a function that enables users of the app to compare their tickets against historical lottery data, allowing them to determine if they would have ever won in the past. Additionally, our project provided users with the ability to calculate winning probabilities for any number of tickets, empowering them with a comprehensive understanding of their chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "By effectively communicating our findings in a concise manner, we hope to raise awareness about the probabilities involved in lottery games and assist individuals in making informed decisions. Through the logical core we developed, the app can serve as a valuable tool for individuals struggling with gambling addictions, allowing them to better estimate their chances and potentially seek appropriate support."
