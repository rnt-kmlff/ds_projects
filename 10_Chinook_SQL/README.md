# Chinook music store: SQL project

In this project, our goal is to analyze the Chinook database, a fictional digital music store, and provide insights related to various business tasks. We will take a concise and straightforward approach to communicate our findings effectively.

First, we will select the first three albums to be added to the store from a new record label, considering sales by genre in the USA.

Next, we will evaluate the performance of sales support agents by analyzing customer purchases. Specifically, we will examine whether any agent outperforms or underperforms compared to others.

Furthermore, we will analyze sales data from different countries to understand trends.

Lastly, we will assess the impact of changing the purchasing strategy on overall revenue. Specifically, we will determine the percentage of individual track purchases versus whole album purchases.

By following a concise and matter-of-fact approach, we aim to provide a quick and informative read that presents the project's goal, approach, and key findings clearly.
