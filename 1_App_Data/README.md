# Finding Perspective App Niches - Analyzing AppStore and Google Play Data

The goal of this project is to analyze app data and determine what kind of apps is most likely to attract more users both on iOS and Android.

We will look at two datasets, for iOS and Android apps:
- A dataset containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018:

- A dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017:
https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv

We will analyze the data from the point of view of an app-developing company focused on free apps, with revenue coming from in-app ads, thus we are keen to know what kind of apps are the most popular and successful.
