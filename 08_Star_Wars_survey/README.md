# Star Wars Fans Speak: Analyzing Movie Preferences and Gender Differences

This project aims to explore the Star Wars movies fanbase and answer key questions regarding their preferences. To reach this goal, we utilized data collected by FiveThirtyEight through SurveyMonkey.

After analyzing the data, we discovered some interesting findings. Firstly, 'The Empire Strikes Back' was the clear favorite among all Star Wars movies. Secondly, the original trilogy was more popular among respondents than the newer trilogy, with 'The Phantom Menace' being the most watched of the newer movies. Thirdly, male respondents were more likely to have seen all the movies compared to female respondents who mainly watched the original trilogy. Lastly, both male and female respondents equally favored 'The Empire Strikes Back' while showing a dislike for the newer trilogy.

These results provide insights into the preferences of the Star Wars fanbase and highlight the enduring popularity of the original trilogy. The concise and straightforward presentation of our findings will make our project an accessible and informative read for employers.
