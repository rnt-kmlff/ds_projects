# Revealing Fandango's Movie Ratings Discrepancies: Pre and Post Controversy

In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator).

Hickey found that there was a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating he was able to find in the HTML of the page.

In this data science project, our goal is to examine whether there were any changes in Fandango's rating system following a previous analysis conducted in 2015. To reach this goal, we compare the characteristics of the rating system before and after the analysis, using data from films released in 2016 and 2017.

We found that both the 2015 and 2016 ratings distributions were left-skewed, with modes of 4.5 stars and 4 stars, respectively. However, the 2016 ratings appeared to be more normally distributed around the mode, while the 2015 ratings were heavily skewed towards higher rankings.

Interestingly, there were slight changes in the summary statistics for the 2015 ratings, with the mean decreasing from 4.0 to 3.9 and the mode shifting from 4.5 to 4.0. The median remained the same at 4.0 stars.

While it remains unclear whether the differences observed were a result of changes in Fandango's rating system or other factors, it is noteworthy that as of 2023, Fandango no longer explicitly displays 5-star ratings on their website, and their subsidiary, Rotten Tomatoes, employs a verified rating system.

Overall, our findings provide insight into the distribution and summary statistics of movie ratings on Fandango, highlighting potential changes that occurred in the rating system over time.
