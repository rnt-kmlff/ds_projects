# Segmenting Credit Card Customers with K-Means Clustering

This project analyzes a dataset of credit card customer information to segment customers into groups in order to tailor business strategies. The goal is to define unique customer segments and summarize key characteristics using the K-means clustering algorithm. 

The dataset contains features like income, credit limit, account usage, gender, and marital status. By feeding these features into the K-means algorithm, distinct customer segments emerge based on credit risk, spending habits, demographics, and marketing potential. 

Initial analysis identified 5 unique clusters: average clients, high-risk low income married females, high-value low-risk male clients, high-risk low income single females, and middle income mixed gender clients. These groups present opportunities to adjust credit limits, target rewards programs, and provide financial counseling. This segmentation demonstrates how machine learning can provide actionable insights.

The rest of the report will detail the approach, methodology, and interpretation of key results. Segmenting customers in this way is crucial for developing customized business strategies that maximize value.
