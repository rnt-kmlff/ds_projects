# 23 Years of Exchange Rate Dynamics: A Visual Analysis of EUR vs USD and RUB

This data science project aims to analyze the exchange rate dynamics of the Euro (EUR) against the US Dollar (USD) and the Russian Ruble (RUB) from 1999 to present, with a focus on visualizing the results. The daily exchange rates dataset was provided and updated by Darya Chemkaeva on Kaggle, containing data from the European Central Bank Statistical Data Warehouse.

Our approach involved analyzing the impact of quantitative easing (QE) by the US Federal Reserve on the EUR-USD exchange rate and studying the performance of the RUB against the EUR over the past 23 years. The findings indicate that all four rounds of QE had no significant impact on the EUR-USD exchange rate, with the rate recovering or depreciating in the following years. Meanwhile, the RUB has depreciated over three times against the EUR due to global and local crises affecting the Russian economy.

Overall, our project provides valuable insights into the exchange rate dynamics of the EUR, USD, and RUB, highlighting the impact of significant economic events on currency performance.
