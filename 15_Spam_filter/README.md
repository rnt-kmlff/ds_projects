# SpamGuard: Developing a High-Accuracy SMS Spam Filter Using Naive Bayes

In this concise and tidy guided project, our goal is to develop a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. To achieve this, we utilized a dataset consisting of 5,572 SMS messages that were already classified by humans.

The dataset, curated by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our approach involved dividing the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing. We employed Laplace smoothing with an alpha value of 1 and implemented a custom function for message classification based on the Naive Bayes algorithm.

Remarkably, our spam filter demonstrated an exceptional accuracy of 98.74% when applied to the test dataset. This result surpassed our initial objective of achieving an accuracy exceeding 80%. By successfully communicating our findings, we establish the effectiveness of our filter in accurately identifying spam messages.
