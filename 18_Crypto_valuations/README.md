# Benchmarking Crypto Valuations: A Data-Driven Approach

The goal of this analysis is to estimate the potential valuation range for a new crypto platform called Extra Finance (https://app.extrafi.io/). We will benchmark comparable platforms to derive data-driven valuation estimates for Extra Finance based on its current adoption metrics.

Our approach will involve analyzing historical data on the ratio of platform volumes (TVL) to their associated decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes to project a feasible TVL range for Extra Finance. We will also benchmark Market Cap/TVL ratios of competitors to estimate valuation multiples. Applying these benchmarks to Extra Finance's adoption metrics will produce a valuation range.

The analysis found Extra Finance's current USD 25M TVL and USD 3M Market Cap sit near the lower bound of the projected USD 26-65M TVL and USD 3-9M Market Cap ranges based on benchmarks. This implies opportunities for growth if Extra Finance continues increasing adoption. The data-driven framework provides grounded estimates for new crypto valuations.
