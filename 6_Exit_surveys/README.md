# Uncovering Employee Satisfaction Trends: An Analysis of DETE and TAFE Exit Surveys

This project aims to analyze exit surveys from the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes in Queensland, Australia. Our goal is to identify potential reasons for employee resignations, with a specific focus on factors such as length of service and age.

After conducting data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization techniques on the DETE and TAFE datasets obtained from dataquest.io, we have identified some interesting trends. Our analysis shows that employees who have been working in the institutes for a longer period of time tend to resign with some level of dissatisfaction, while new employees tend to resign rather satisfied.

Additionally, we found that people approaching retirement may feel somewhat dissatisfied when they resign, while young employees are by far the most satisfied category. These findings might be valuable insights for both the DETE and TAFE institutes and can inform potential interventions to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
