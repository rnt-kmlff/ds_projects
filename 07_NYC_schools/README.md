# SAT Scores and Demographics: Uncovering Correlations in NYC High Schools

This project explores the relationships between demographics and SAT scores in New York City schools. Using data published by the city, we aimed to identify patterns and correlations between various factors such as school size, safety, demographics, and Advanced Placement exam participation, and their impact on SAT scores.

To achieve our goal, we analyzed the available data and used various statistical techniques to identify meaningful patterns and relationships. We also created visualizations to help us understand and communicate our findings effectively.

Our analysis revealed several interesting results. We found a positive correlation between overall school size and SAT scores, while smaller schools with "International" in their names tended to have lower SAT scores, possibly due to a focus on serving immigrant or international students. Additionally, there appears to be a positive correlation between perceived school safety and SAT scores, with schools in Manhattan, Bronx, and Queens being perceived as the safest.

Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the percentage of white and Asian students in the school and SAT scores, and a negative correlation between the percentage of black and Hispanic students. We also identified schools that serve predominantly Hispanic student populations with low SAT scores, which have a focus on serving diverse student populations. On the other hand, we found specialized public high schools with very low percentages of Hispanic students and high SAT scores that require the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) for admission.

Lastly, we discovered a positive correlation between the percentage of Advanced Placement exam takers in the school and its SAT score. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that impact SAT scores in New York City schools.
